In this talk, I’ll walk you through my (somewhat messy) journey of building and deploying an Elixir/Phoenix app on Azure. This isn’t a ‘how-to’ guide; it’s a real-world story of how we developed the app from scratch, covering everything from writing the Elixir code, setting up deployment, managing the infrastructure, and implementing CI/CD processes to making it production-ready. I’ll share the challenges we faced along the way, such as dealing with maxed-out database CPU usage and setting up effective logging and monitoring using tools like Azure Logs and AppSignal. While we tried to follow best practices, this isn’t a step-by-step guide to the “perfect” approach; it’s more about what worked for us, what didn’t, and the lessons we learned.

Whether you’re an experienced Elixir developer or just getting started, you’ll walk away, hopefully, with a mix of practical insights and some things to avoid.

**KEY OBJECTIVE:**
- Give some insight on how deploy an Elixir/Phoenix app on Azure
- Share some (hopefully) good insight about real world problems

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**
- Any beginner/intermediate Elixir developer that hasn't had the opportunity to deploy in production a medium size app
