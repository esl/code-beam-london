This tutorial will guide you through Test-Driven Development (TDD) using the Phoenix Framework,
specifically focusing on creating a RESTful application with Ecto for database interaction.
You'll learn how to implement and test a REST API from scratch, using Phoenix's built-in tools
for writing, running, and automating tests.

**DELIVERY CHANNEL**
In person

**EXPERTISE**

Intermediate

**DURATION**

8 hours (including breaks and lunch)

**PREREQUISITES**

- Basic Elixir

**TRAINING OBJECTIVES**

- Grasp the core principles of TDD and how to apply the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle to guide
the development process.
- Learn how TDD ensures code reliability, reduces bugs, and encourages better code
design through incremental testing.
- Learn to build a RESTful API using the Phoenix Framework with Elixir.
- Implement key Phoenix components, including:
     - Set up and manage database schema changes through migrations.
     - Validate and cast incoming data before database insertion.
     - Set up and configure routes to handle API requests.
     - Manage incoming requests, apply business logic, and return responses.
     - Render API responses in JSON.
     - Apply Atomic Design Methodology for structuring views and templates to promote reusable components.
- Use ExUnit testing framework, to write unit and integration tests.
- Test Phoenix endpoints to ensure the REST API works as expected.
- Write tests for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and validate the correct handling
of HTTP requests and responses.
- Ensure that Ecto and Phoenix components are well-tested before deployment to catch errors
early and prevent regressions.

By the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to confidently build, test, and deploy a RESTful
Phoenix application, ensuring both high code quality and correct API functionality through test-driven design.
