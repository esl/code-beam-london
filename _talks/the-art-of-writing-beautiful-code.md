This will be a talk about how we write code. As it usually happens with Brujo, this is going to be a talk about Maintainability. Brujo will try to use his experience as a trainer and an engineer to go over a variety of tips and examples on how to write more maintainable code that will make your life as a developer and the lives of those who work with you much easier and enjoyable.

**KEY OBJECTIVE:**
- It should provide some guidelines on what to do and what to avoid in order to make your code more maintainable.

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**
- Erlang developers, mostlyâ€¦ but all developers in general can learn something, too.
