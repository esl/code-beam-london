RabbitMQ is considered to be one of the most reliable and scalable message broker applications. It is used by many developers and in many applications, all with great feedback. When you need to implement a scalable, native and performant way to publish messages to RabbitMQ in your Erlang application, researching the AMQP client documentation and GitHub will help you decide how to best implement your publisher.

In this talk we will take a lessons-learned approach to talk about how we implemented a RabbitMQ publisher using the Erlang AMQP client library. We will go over various implementation models for the RabbitMQ publisher, and their pros and cons. I will also discuss how to design the publisher with scalability in mind and validate the implementation.

**KEY OBJECTIVE:**
- Draw attention and interest to the Erlang AMQP client

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**
- Erlang developers of all skill levels
