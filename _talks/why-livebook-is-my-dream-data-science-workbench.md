Livebook is not just an environment for interactive code notebooks. With very little effort, it's a fully-fledged data science environment, from analytics and reproducible reports to fine tuning LLMs. And, thanks to the BEAM, it's trivial to perform key tasks that are integral to data science workflows but can be challenging in other ecosystems like pulling production data and running workloads on arbitrary hardware. In this talk, I'll use real-world examples to illustrate how these pieces fit together into a truly unique data science workbench.

**KEY OBJECTIVE:**
- Pull together many of the exciting innovations in the Elixir data science and machine learning ecosystem, showing how they fit together and can be leveraged to do serious data science work.

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**
- Data scientists from outside the Elixir ecosystem, folks using the BEAM who may not be doing data science or machine learning, anyone interested in data science work.
