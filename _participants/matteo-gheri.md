Matteo is a backend developer at Pocketworks who’s all about creating smooth-running backend systems that solve real problems. His love for coding started early on, modding Civilization II as a kid and diving into tech from there. After starting out as a fullstack developer, he’s now focused mainly on backend work with Elixir and Phoenix, plus some Python here and there. At Pocketworks, Matteo handles everything from databases to DevOps, making sure things run reliably behind the scenes. When he’s not coding, he’s probably riding his motorcycle around Europe or exploring new tech over a good coffee.
