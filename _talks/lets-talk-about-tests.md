We all know that testing is important. We should have tests from the start of the project and do variety of tests to ensure that the application works as expected. We should thoroughly test the code before it goes into production and we should constantly work on expanding the coverage and add tests of corner cases.

BUT that’s theory and then life comes. Unfortunately, there are way too many projects with little to no tests, deprecated tests, and teams too busy to spare time for writing tests. In this talk we’ll discuss where to start, how to pick and prioritise test, and how to work with managers and testers to ensure that you are covered.

**KEY OBJECTIVE:**
- Share approaches to increase code "coverage" by tests.

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**
- Those who struggle to find time for tests and convince managers that tests are actually needed.
- Those who work with code that has very limited tests and not sure where to start.
